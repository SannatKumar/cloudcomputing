# Multi Cloud and DevOps Technologies 
MultiCloud is a new concept that helps achieve business goals.(Using more than one cloud Providers.)

Cloud Providers themselves are collaborating to provide services.
Learn  more about Devops practices and trends.


# Major Cloud Providers:
Google Cloud,
AWS,
Microsoft Azure,
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

These cloud providers can be known as Smart house.

Multi Cloud is the new normal.

How Devops technologies can make the cloud Smarter?
Devops tools is a set of tools and practices that can help deliver the applications to end user faster and efficiently in a optimized way.

Automate the deployment process.

# Terramform:
Terraform file is .tf file.
below is the command to run terraform config file that can run multiple instances.
--$ terraform apply.  

# Infrastructure Provisioning
Traditional way: Manually Deploying the Application to Server.

Devops Way: Current trends of automating to deploy the applications.

Few lines of Configuration can help to create multiple instances instead of doing manually. 
AWS Console: 

# Ansible
Ansible is Configuration management tool and it can execute the configuration file across multiple instances parallely.
Ansible Palybook is a set of tasks.

Ansible can open Multiple SSH sessions and install apache in different servers parallel.


# Docker
Docker is container runtime that allows you to deploy applications in the cloud in a containerized way  without having to worry 
about managing servers.
Docker is a lightweight version that we dont have to carry about kernel and the operating system inside container which makes it very very efficient.
Cost Effective and Efficient way.
Container technologies to deploy the applications and thats when docker shines.

# Kubernetes
Before: Application orchestration manually.
Everytime scaling up was done manually.
For Micro Service Architectures, ther was need for a single tool to orchestrate those environments in a fully automated way.
Container Orchestration Tool: The most popular is Kubernetes.

Inside Kubernetes Cluster we have pods. Pods are the smallest units on the kubernetes cluster that will have one or more containers that would deliver the application to the end users.

The new Era has begun. Multi Cloud and Devops.
